                <h1>Family</h1>
                <p> The Iranian culture is very family orientated and we are taught from an early age to always be there for our family members. People will come and leave from your life, 
                    but you only have one family and are connected with them no matter the distance. I have a brother who is 7 years older than me and my mother is the sole provider in our family.
                    Growing up I learnt a lot from my grandfather who was a very passionate and disciplined man. He taught me that if you want something you need to work for it and no matter what happens no one can take away your accomplishments from you. 
                    I carry his lessons with me and hope that he is proud of me.
