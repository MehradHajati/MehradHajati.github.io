                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Hello, my name is Mehrad Hajati. I was born and raised in Iran, Tehran. When I was fifteen years old I travelled to the Netherlands to get my International Baccalaureate (IB), leaving my family and friends behind.
                After I completed my IB diploma, I travelled to Canada for my undergrad studies at Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick. I am interested in Computer Science, Math and Physics.
                I also enjoy going to the gym, running marathons and playing video games.

                <h1>Family</h1>
                <p> The Iranian culture is very family orientated and we are taught from an early age to always be there for our family members. People will come and leave from your life, 
                    but you only have one family and are connected with them no matter the distance. I have a brother who is 7 years older than me and my mother is the sole provider in our family.
                    Growing up I learnt a lot from my grandfather who was a very passionate and disciplined man. He taught me that if you want something you need to work for it and no matter what happens no one can take away your accomplishments from you. 
                    I carry his lessons with me and hope that he is proud of me.

                <h1>Education</h1>
                <p>As I said I graduated high school with an IB diploma and then came to Mount Allison University. I am currently in my last year of undergrad and
                    will graduate from Mount Allison University with an Honours in Computer Science and a triple minor in Mathematics, Physics, and Astronomy. 
                    I plan on pursuing a masters in Applied Computer Science, which will give me the necessary experience to become a front-end software engineer.

                <h1>Physical Activities</h1>
                <p>I am a strong believer in staying physically active. I go to the gym five days a week for strength training and run three times a week. I finished the Blue Nose half-marathon 
                    in 1 hour and 56 minutes in the summer of 2023 in Halifax. I plan on running the Blue Nose marathon in the summer of 2024 and am currently training for it. 
                    I can bench 225 pounds for 4 reps, can squat 315 for 2 reps, and can deadlift 365 pounds for 2 reps.

                <h1>Research Assistant</h1>
                <p>I did research with Professor Ralf Bruening at Mount Allison University during the summers of 2022 and 2023. 
                    During the first summer, my main responsibility was to solve a geometric problem between two different data sets 
                    from Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), for which I created "JCube". 
                    I created JCube using the AWT and Swing packages in Java with an MVC structure. Using R, I was able to visualize the data and present them to the research investors. 
                    During the second summer, I started coding in C to visualize and tilt a surface according to given parameters. I presented my research during the Atlantic Undergraduate Physics
                    and Astronomy Conference at Saint Mary's University; and again during the Canadian Undergraduate Physics Conference at Waterloo University for professors and students.
                    We published a paper in the Journal of Microscopy which you can find here:</p>

                <h1> Website Developer</h1>
                <p> I did volunteer work for a friend's business name "CultureConnect". I created a website for them using JavaScript and Wix. Recieved the Future New Brunswick grant for my work.
                    You can view the website here: </p>

                <h1> Teaching Assistant</h1>
                <p> I have worked as a teacher's assistant for three years at Mount Allison University. I have been the teacher's assistant in Calculus II, Applied Calculus.
                    Discrete Structures, Linear Algebra, Digital Signal Processing, and General Physics II. I learned how to communicate abstract mathematical ideas, developed my communication
                    and social skills.
