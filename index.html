<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Mehrad Hajati. I was born and raised in Iran, Tehran. When I was fifteen years old I travelled to the Netherlands to get my International Baccalaureate (IB), leaving my family and friends behind.</p>
<p> After I completed my IB diploma, I travelled to Canada for my undergrad at Mount Allison University in Sackville New Brunswick. </p>
